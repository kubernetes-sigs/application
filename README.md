# Kubernetes Applications

> Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

The above description, from the [Kubernetes homepage](https://kubernetes.io/), is centered on containerized _applications_. Yet, the Kubernetes metadata, objects, and visualizations (e.g., within Dashboard) are focused on container infrastructure rather than the applications themselves.

The Application CRD (Custom Resource Definition) and Controller in this project aim to change that in a way that's interoperable between many supporting tools.

**It provides:**

* The ability to describe an applications metadata (e.g., that an application like WordPress is running)
* A point to connect the infrastructure, such as Deployments, to as a root object. This is useful for tying things together and even cleanup (i.e., garbage collection)
* Information for supporting applications to help them query and understand the objects supporting an application
* Application level health checks

**This can be used by:**

* Application operators who want to center what they operate on applications
* Tools, such as Helm, that center their package releases on application installations can do so in a way that's interoperable with other tools (e.g., Dashboard)
* Dashboards that want to visualize the applications in addition to or instead of an infrastructure view

## Goals

1. Provide a standard API for creating, viewing, and managing applications in Kubernetes.
1. Provide a CLI implementation, via kubectl, that interacts with the Application API.
1. Provide installation status and garbage collection for applications.
1. Provide a standard way for applications to surface a basic health check to the UIs.
1. Provide an explicit mechanism for applications to declare dependencies on another application.
1. Promote interoperability among ecosystem tools and UIs by creating a standard that tools MAY implement.
1. Promote the use of common labels and annotations for Kubernetes Applications.

## Non-Goals

1. Create a standard that all tools MUST implement.
1. Provide a way for UIs to surface metrics from an application.

## What is the Application CRD?
The Application CRD provides a way for you to aggregate individual Kubernetes components (e.g. Sevrices, Deployemnts,
StatefulSets, Ingresses, CRDs), and manage them as a group. It provides UIs with a resource that allows for the
aggregation and display of all the components in the Application.

## Building
This project uses the [kubebuilder](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubebuilder) tool to for code generation.
kubebuilder provides the same code generation features (and a bit more) for Custom Resource Definitions and Extension
API Servers that are provided by the Kubernetes project. In order to build the source, you need to download and install
the latest release of kubebuilder per the instructions there.

### Controller
The controller doesn't do much at the moment. However, if you'd like to build it you'll need to install Docker and
golang 1.9 or greater. To build the controller into an image named ```image``` use the following command.

```commandline
docker <image> -f Dockerfile.controller
```

## Installing the CRD
In order to install the CRD you will either need to use kubectl or you will need to call against the Kubernetes CRD
API directly. An example [manifest](hack/install.yaml) is supplied in the hack directory. You can use the following
command to install the CRD (where ```manifest`` is the manifest containing the CRD declaration).

```commandline
kubectl apply -f <manifest>
```

## Generating an Installation Manifest
When the CRD is installed as above, you need to ensure that the correct RBAC configuration is applied prior to
installation. You can use `kubebulider create config` to generate a manifest that is configured to create the
requisite RBAC permissions, CRD, and controller StatefulSet in the supplied namespace. The command below will generate
a manifest that can be applied to create all of the necessary components the `mage` as the controller
image and `namespace` as the namespace. Note that, if you would like to remove the controller from the configuration
you can delete the generated StatefulSet from the manifest, and, while you must specify a controller image, you need
can supply any string if you do not wish to install the controller when the manifest is applied (i.e. you intend to
delete the StatefulSet from the generated manifest). Work is in progress to generate a controllerless configuration.

```commandline
kubebulider create config --controller-image <image>  --name <namespace>
```

## Using the Application CRD
The application CRD can be used both via manifests and programmatically.

### Manifests
The docs directory contains a [manifest](docs/example.yaml) that shows how to you can integrate the Application CRD
with a WordPress deployment.

The Application object shown below declares that the Application is a WordPress installation that uses StatefulSets
and Services. It also contains some other relevant metadata described above.

```yaml
apiVersion: app.k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: "wordpress-01"
  componentKinds:
    - group: core
      kind: Service
    - group: apps
      kind: Deployment
    - group: apps
      kind: StatefulSet
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: "wordpress-01"
    app.kubernetes.io/version: "3"
  spec:
    type: "wordpress"
    selector:
      matchLabels:
       app.kubernetes.io/name: "wordpress-01"
    version: "4.9.4"
    description: "WordPress is open source software you can use to create a beautiful website, blog, or app."
    maintainers:
      - name: Kenneth Owens
        email: kow3ns@github.com
    owners: "Kenneth Owens kow3ns@github.com"
    keywords:
     - "cms"
     - "blog"
     - "wordpress"
    links:
      about: "https://wordpress.org/"
      web-server-dashboard: "https://metrics/internal/wordpress-01/web-app"
      web-server-dashboard: "https://metrics/internal/wordpress-01/mysql"
```

Notice that each Service and StatefulSet is labeled such that Application's Selector matches the labels.

```yaml
app.kubernetes.io/name: "wordpress-01"
```

The additional labels on the Applications components come from the recommended application labels and annotations.

You can use the standard `kubectl` verbs (e.g. `get`, `apply`, `create`, `delete`, `list`, `watch`) to interact with
an Application specified in a manifest.

### Programmatically
kubebuilder creates a Kubernetes [ClientSet](pkg/client/clientset/versioned/clientset.go) for the Application object.
You can create a new client using either a rest.Config or a rest.Interface as below.

```go
client,err := clientset.NewForConfig(config)

client := clientset.New(ri)
```

Once you've created a client you can interact with Applications via the structs declared in
[types.go](pkg/apis/app/v1alpha1/application_types.go). For instance to retrieve an application you can used the code
below.

```go
app, err := client.AppV1Aplha1().Applications("my-namespace").Get("my-app",v1.GetOptions{})
if err != nil {
        handleError(err)
}
```

The other standard client operations are supported. The interface is described
[here](pkg/client/clientset/versioned/typed/app/v1alpha1/application.go).
